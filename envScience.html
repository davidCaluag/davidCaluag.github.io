            <h2>What Is the Issue?</h2>
            
            <div class = "solution-card">
                
                <p>"Since the 1930s, the polymers industry has completely altered daily life: Plastics are in our homes, cars, clothes, furniture, electronics, as well as our single-use throwaway water bottles, food packaging, and takeout containers" (<a href="https://news.mongabay.com/2024/11/microplastics-are-sickening-and-killing-wildlife-disrupting-earth-systems/" target="_blank">Guynup, 2024</a>). Microplastics—and nanoplastics derived from primary and secondary sources like large plastic chunks—are "being detected in many environments across the globe, from ocean bottoms to mountain peaks" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c03856" target="_blank">Al Harraq et al., 2025</a>).</p>
            
                <p>Microplastics, a combination of nanoplastics, are found in a length range of 1–1000 μm (micrometer), while nanoplastics peak at a length of 100 nm (nanometer) (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13762-022-04261-1" target="_blank">Lamichhane et al., 2023</a>; <a href="https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.4c03856" target="_blank">Al Harraq et al., 2025</a>). In 2023, researchers have seen an "emergence of microplastics in the human body [... Found in places like] feces, blood, placenta, lower airway, and lungs" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168946" target="_blank">Zhao et al., 2024</a>). The future's trajectory is quite alarming because of how rapidly it may negatively impact the environment and public health (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s13762-022-04261-1" target="_blank">Lamichhane et al., 2023</a>). "Notably, the entry of plastics into the gastrointestinal tract can result in various ailments, including dysbiosis of gut microflora and microbial biodiversity" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heliyon.2025.e09867" target="_blank">Zhang et al., 2023</a>). Constant or prolonged exposure may "potentially [lead] to various negative effects, such as reduced growth rates and energy levels, physiological stress, cell death, developmental abnormalities, altered lipid metabolism, and intestinal damage" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.136538" target="_blank">de Ruijter et al., 2025</a>). Additionally, "an increased risk of stomach cancer was noticed with more prolonged exposure to synthetic [fiber] dust" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168946" target="_blank">Zhao et al., 2024</a>). Microplastics can be directly linked to "oxidative stress and the antioxidant defense system failure." Oxidative stress "plays a role in many conditions like cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and heart disease. Toxins like pollution and cigarette smoke can cause oxidative stress, while foods rich in antioxidants can help reduce it" (<a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/oxidative-stress" target="_blank">Cleveland Clinic, n.d.</a>).</p>
                
                <p>"Due to the widespread distribution and persistent existence of [microplastics] in the environment, there is an urgent necessity to comprehensively understand [and reverse] the potentially harmful effects and mechanisms of MPs (including smaller NPs) on human health" (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168946" target="_blank">Zhao et al., 2024</a>).</p>

            <h2>Microplastics are Everywhere</h2>
            <p>When plastic-based products break down, they do not biodegrade. Instead, they break down into microplastics, which are the size of a sesame seed or smaller. They are made of numerous different toxic chemical components, making them capable of poisoning everything they touch. Worst of all? They are literally everywhere. Here are some solutions that could be done:</p>

                    <h3 class="solution-title">1. Banning Certain Microplastics</h3>
                    <p>Banning certain microplastics might work, but only if companies get on board. In 2020, the European Union (EU) released a sweeping ban on microplastics which covered about 90 percent of all plastic pollutants. According to The Guardian, the main goal of this ban was to cut plastic pollution by about 400,000 tons over the intervening two decades. On average, about 36,000 tons of microplastic fibers and fragments a year would no longer be permitted to be "intentionally added" to products.</p>

                    <h3 class="solution-title">2. Plastic Microfiber Filtration</h3>
                    <p>Plastic microfiber filtration could help scoop up the problem at home. The solution to this particular problem could be in developing house-based filtration systems capable of capturing these microplastics before they make their way into the sewer. If that works, such technology could be used to solve other "particulate" problems and be repurposed as a means to remove other types of microplastics from waterways the world over. As it happens, this technology does exist in some form or another.</p>

                    <p>Magnets could be employed to attract microplastics. In 2019, the Google Science Fair winner was 18-year-old Fionn Ferreira, of West Cork, Ireland. His experiment proved that using magnetite powder, a type of iron oxide, could be used to clean up oil spills.</p>

                    <p>Mass cleanups may be our best solution. The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a big problem all its own, and we can only solve that problem by cleaning things up before it gets any worse. Once that plastic becomes microplastic, it becomes nearly impossible to clean up. Thus, the solution could be removing plastic from the ocean before it becomes micro in the first place. Charities and environmental groups are already working to fix the problem as best they can.</p>

                <p>"[...Learning] the consequences of failing to comply with reality should often have a call for urgency. Even more so when the consequences directly affect those who are in charge. Economically, health-wise, and their future children are affected by this plague. Paying attention to emerging issues like these before they start-- to get out of hand is a great way to prevent chronic headaches and perpetual anxiety. Of course, issues often emerge altogether and/or at different levels of [urgency... Many articles have offered] enough information to highlight a definitive reason (Oxidative stress) why [microplastic should remain] at the top level of urgency. Whether it be our health, wildlife, or the environment, microplastics show a gradual and growing impact, and the solution remains unsolvable. What is worse is that we do not know its full capability. [Many sources] can be very persuasive as [they have] argued since 2023 that if we keep microplastics unattended in our environment, health, and wildlife, the prolonged pain will be very costly."

            <p>the button WILL NOT UPDATE THE NUMBER ON GITHUB<p>
            <p>So, basically, the counter doesn't increment unless I include a back-end. I don't want to, because it's an integer and the overhead is too much maintaining and securing the back-end. I wanted to pull the data from the count.txt (in the github), but that doesn't work because Github pages are static ^_^ (i.e., whatever happens in the website will not reflect change elsewhere but your web browser) </p><p>My initial approach ended up getting scratched, and I didn't want to pivot to creating a database. The button is pseudo, haha, my fault. It works on your end though :D Enjoy that.</p>
