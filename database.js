//const db = new sqlite3.Database('mydatabase.db');

/*
My plan:

->I thought about deploying a local database in the github repo. 
I, will, then pull the data from the local database and display it on my html pages. 
To update the display data, I just update the local database :p
I thought about doing that automatically so I don't have to pay for cloud services ^_^
or PaaS/IaaS because Github already offers the fundies (fundamentals).
